# Single-cell-RNA-Sequencing-Analysis

## Overview 

In recent years, the field of single-cell genomics has witnessed an unprecedented level of growth, pushing the boundaries of our biological understanding. The ability to measure and analyze individual cells' DNA, RNA, and protein constitution has allowed for an in-depth view of complex biological systems, yielding insights into processes such as human embryonic development, novel disease-associated cell types, and potential cell-targeted therapeutic interventions. Machine learning models can reveal unique characteristics of individual cells, providing insights into how gene regulation affects blood and immune cell differentiation and maturation over time.

This project seeks to delve further into this rich biological data by employing advanced machine-learning models to explore how these genetic factors co-vary as bone marrow stem cells mature into blood cells.
